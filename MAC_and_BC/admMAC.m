function [E, b, theta, w, f] = admMAC(G, bu, Eu)
% This is the ellipsoid method part and the main function to call.

% the inputs are: 
% 1)  G, an Ly by U by N channel matrix. Ly is the number of receiver antennas, 
%     U is the total number of users and N is the total number of tones.
%     G(:,:,n) is the channel matrix for all users on tone n
%     and G(:,u,n) is the channel for user u on tone n. In this code we assume each user 
%     only has single transmit antenna, thus G(:,u,n) is a column vector. 
% 2)  Eu, a U by 1 vector containing power constraints for all the users.
% 3)  bu, a U by 1 vector containing the target rates for all the users.

% the outputs are:
% 1)  E, a U by N matrix containing the powers for all users and over all tones
%     that support the rate vector given in bu. E(u,:) is the power allocation for
%     user u over all tones. An all zero E indicates that the given rates
%     in bu are not achievable with given powers in Eu.
% 2)  b, a U by N matrix containing the rates of all users on all tones after convergence.
%     Again, all zero rates indicates that given bu is not achievable with
%     Eu.
% 3)  theta, the optimal U by 1 dual variable vector containing optimal weights
%     of rates. theta determines the decoding order.
% 4)  w, the optimal U by 1 dual variable vector containing optimal weights
%     of powers.
% 5) f, the dual optimal value.
