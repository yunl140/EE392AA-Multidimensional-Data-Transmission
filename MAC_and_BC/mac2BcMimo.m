% This function converts the covariace matrices in a Gaussian MAC to corresponding
% covariance matrices in its Dual BC. These covariance matrices achieve the
% same set of rates in the dual BC by dirty paper coding scheme. The
% encoding order in the BC is the reverse of the decoding order in the MAC.
% The total number of users is denoted by K. The decoding order in the MAC
% is given by K by 1 vector pi. pi(k) is the user that is decoded kth in
% the successive decoding. H is a t by r by K matrix containing all the
% channel matrices of the MAC. H(:,:,k) is the channel matrix for user k in
% the MAC. t and r are the number of transmit and receive antennas in the
% BC. S is a r by r by K matrix containing the covariance matrices of the
% MAC. S(:,:,k) is the covariance matrix for user k in the MAC. G is the
% function output which will contain the covariance matrices of the BC.
% G(:,:,k) is the covariance matrix for user k. This function is for just
% an MIMO-BC and does not include parallel MIMO-BCs.
