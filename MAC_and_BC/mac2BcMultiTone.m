% This function converts the covariace matrices in a Gaussian MAC to corresponding
% covariance matrices in its Dual BC. These covariance matrices achieve the
% same set of rates in the dual BC by dirty paper coding scheme. The
% encoding order in the BC is the reverse of the decoding order in the MAC.
% The total number of users is denoted by K. The decoding order in the MAC
% is given by K by 1 vector ind. ind(k) is the user that is decoded kth in
% the successive decoding. H is a n by K by N matrix containing all the
% channel matrices of the MAC. H(:,k,i) is the channel matrix for user k on tone i in
% the MAC. n is the number transmit antennas in the BC (receiver antennas
% in the MAC). S is a n by n by K by N matrix containing the covariance matrices of the
% each user of BC on each tone. Gtot is a n by n by K matrix containing the
% total covariance matrices of the BC on each tone. r is a K by N matrix 
% containing the individual user rates. This function is 
% written for just one receive antenna per user for the BC and is for 
% parallel BCs and MACs (multi tone).

% the inputs are:
% 1)  H, an n by K by N channel matrix. H(:,k, n) is the channel 
%     vector for user k on tone n. This code assumes each user has just one
%     transmit antenna. n is the number of receive antennas and n=K in DSL.
% 2)  P, a K by N vector of powers for each user on each tone.
% 3)  ind, a K by 1 vector that specified the decoding order in the MAC. 
%     ind(k) is the user that is decoded kth in the successive decoding.
