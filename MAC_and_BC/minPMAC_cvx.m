function [Eun, theta, bun] = minPMAC_cvx(H, bu_min, w, cb)
% minPMAC_cvx solves minimize sum_u(w_u*tr(Rxx(u))), subject to
% bu>=bu_min
% This function uses CVX package

% the inputs are: 
% 1)  H, an Ly by U by N channel matrix. Ly is the number of receiver antennas, 
%     U is the total number of users and N is the total number of tones.
%     H(:,:,n) is the channel matrix for all users on tone n
%     and H(:,u,n) is the channel for user u on tone n. In this code we assume each user 
%     only has single transmit antenna, thus H(:,u,n) is a column vector.
%     To get H from a time-domain channel h, use fft(h, N, 3)
% 2)  bu, a U by 1 vector containing the target rates for all the users.
% 3)  w, a U by 1 vector containing the weights for each user's power.
% 4)  cb, a scalar indicator of whether a real-baseband channel (cb=2) or
%     a complex-baseband channel (cb=1) is used. The default value is cb=1.

% the outputs are:
% 1)  Eu, a U by N matrix containing the powers for all users and over all tones
%     that minimizes the weighted-sum power. E(u,:) is the power allocation for
%     user u over all tones.
% 2)  theta, the optimal U by 1 dual variable vector containing optimal weights
%     of rates. theta determines the decoding order.
% 3)  bu, a U by N matrix containing the rates of all users on all tones after convergence.
